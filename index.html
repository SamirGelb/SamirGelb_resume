<!-- Programs uploaded to GitHub with language in the heading -->
<h2>GitHub Repositories</h2>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/SamirGelb/HyperionDev-Python-Capstone-1">Financial Calculator (Python)</a></h3>
A finance calculator program that allows the user to calculate their interest on an investment or calculate
the amount that should be repaid on a home loan each month.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/SamirGelb/HyperionDev-Python-Capstone-2">Basic Task Manager Program (Python)</a></h3>
Basic task manager program for a small business that can help it to manage tasks assigned to each
member of the team.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/SamirGelb/HyperionDev-Python-Capstone-3">Basic Task Manager Program 2 (Python)</a></h3>
In the previous task manager program, I created a simple task management system that stored data in text files.
In this project, I used lists and dictionaries and functions to extend the functionality of my previous
task manager program. The user can search tasks and edit them in this program

<h3><a href="https://github.com/SamirGelb/HyperionDev-Python-Capstone-4">Warehouse Management Program (Python)</a></h3>
Warehouse management project for a Nike shoe warehouse <br>
<br>
Nike warehouses store the following information for each stock-taking list: Country, Code, Product, Cost,
Quantity, Value.<br>
<br>
Other store managers (in other regions) would like to be able to use this program to do the following:
Search products by code. Determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it. Determine the product
with the highest quantity. Calculate the value of each item entry, based on the quantity and cost of the item.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/SamirGelb/HyperionDev-Java-Capstone-1">Poised PMS 1 (Java)</a></h3>
Poised Part 1
<br>
<br>
You are asked to create a project management system for a small structural engineering firm called “Poised”.
Poised does the engineering needed to ensure the structural integrity of various buildings. They want you to
create a Java program that they can use to keep track of the many projects on which they work. Poised stores
the following information for each project that they work on: Project number. Project name. What type of
building is being designed? E.g. House, apartment block or store, etc. The physical address for the project.
ERF number. The total fee being charged for the project. The total amount paid to date. Deadline for the
project. <br>
<br>
The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the architect for the project.<br>

The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the contractor for the project. <br>

The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the customer for the project. <br>
<br>
Poised wants to be able to use your program to do the following: <br>
Capture information about new projects. If a project name is not provided when the information is captured,
name the project using the surname of the customer. For example, a house being built by Mike Tyson would be
called “House Tyson.” An apartment block owned by Jared Goldman would be called “Apartment Goldman.” <br>

Update information about existing projects. Information may need to be adjusted at different stages throughout
the lifecycle of a project. For example, the deadline might change after a meeting with various stakeholders. <br>

Finalise existing projects. When a project is finalised, the following should happen: An invoice should be
generated for the client. This invoice should contain the customer’s contact details and the total amount that
the customer must still pay. This amount is calculated by subtracting the total amount paid to date from the
total fee for the project. If the customer has already paid the full fee, an invoice should not be generated. <br>

The project should be marked as “finalised” and the completion date should be added. All the information about
the project should be added to a text file called CompletedProject.txt. <br>

See a list of projects that still need to be completed. See a list of projects that are past the due date. <br>

Find and select a project by entering either the project number or project name.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/SamirGelb/HyperionDev-Java-Capstone-3">Poised PMS 2 (Java)</a></h3>
An extension of the first Poised PMS which deals with the Poised project management system and allows the
program to read and write to and from files.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/SamirGelb/HyperionDev-SQL-PoisedPMS">Poised PMS 3 (Java + MySQL)</a></h3>
A continuation of the previous Poised PMS projects using Java and SQL to write projects, architects, customers,
project managers and structural engineers to their own tables in one database.
